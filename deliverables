✅Make the necessary updates to the schema so that a guest can appear on many episodes,

✅as well as an episode can have multiple guests.

✅ I should be able to choose an existing guest, 

 ✅an existing episode, and add a rating. 

 ✅Upon successfully creating an appearance, I should be redirected to the selected episode's show page.



✅On the guests index page, clicking on a guest's name should take us to a detail view about each guest. 
✅This View should include the guest's name and occupation.



 ✅As a user, I should be able to view all of the guests for a particular episode. This means that we'll need an episode's show page that lists out all of the guests who were on that episode
